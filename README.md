Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project! This project is the first step towards building a full web application that emulates the functionality of Airbnb. In this project, we are going to create a command-line interface (CLI) known as "The Console," which allows us to manage AirBnB objects using various commands.

## Background Context

This project is designed to teach us various fundamental concepts in Python, including:

- Python packages and modules
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Creating a command-line interface (CLI)
- Serialization and deserialization of objects
- Unit testing using the `unittest` framework

The project aims to mimic the basic functionalities of Airbnb, focusing on creating classes to represent different elements of the application, managing object serialization and deserialization, and providing a command-line interface for interacting with the objects.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/badrbnh/AirBnB_clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd AirBnB_clone
   ```

3. Run the console:
   ```
   ./console.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the console is launched, you can start using various commands to manage your AirBnB objects. For a list of available commands, type `help` or `help <command>` to get more information about a specific command.

## Commands

The following commands are available in the console:

- `create`: Creates a new instance of a class and saves it to a JSON file.
- `show`: Displays the string representation of an instance.
- `destroy`: Deletes an instance based on the class name and ID.
- `all`: Displays all instances of a class or all instances in the storage.
- `update`: Updates the attributes of an instance.

For a complete list of available commands, refer to the console's built-in help feature.

## File Structure

The project file structure is organized as follows:

- `console.py`: The main command-line interface (CLI) script.
- `models/`: Directory containing class definitions for different AirBnB objects.
- `models/engine/`: Directory containing the storage engine implementation.
- `tests/`: Directory containing unit tests for the project.
